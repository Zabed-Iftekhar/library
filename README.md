Created a library application using HTML,CSS & Javascript. 
It simply takes the input from users in a form and displays the books on the screen. 
Each book's read status could be changed.
Had to take some time to think about the logic which turned out to be simple enough. 
I finally learnt how to use an Object's items and display them as texts on the webpage (this was the trickiest part for me).
